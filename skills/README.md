# 🧩 G-Rec Skills Directory

This directory is reserved for **G-Rec Skills** (Plugins).

## ⚠️ Note on Open Source
In this public repository, the proprietary or heavy skill implementations (such as `live_portrait` and `audio_enhancer`) are **excluded** to keep the core framework lightweight and compliant.

## How to Add Skills
You can implement your own skills following the **G-S Protocol**.
Place your skill folder here (e.g., `skills/my_skill/`) containing:
1.  `SKILL.md` (Prompt/Documentation)
2.  `tool.py` (Executable Entry Point)

See `core/SKILL_INDEX.md` for protocol details.
